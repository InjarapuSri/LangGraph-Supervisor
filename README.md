# LangGraph Supervisor

## Overview
The **LangGraph Supervisor** is an intelligent system designed to manage **complex workflows** across different **machine learning models** and **data pipelines** using **Langchain**. It is particularly useful for **orchestrating multi-step tasks** and **coordinating across AI models** in a seamless, automated fashion.

## Features
- **Model Orchestration**: Manages complex workflows, where different AI models interact in a step-by-step manner.
- **Dynamic Scheduling**: Models can be triggered based on specific conditions, ensuring optimal task flow.
- **Integration with Langchain**: Leverages the **Langchain framework** for flexible model integration and orchestration.
- **Easy to Extend**: Easily extendable to support additional models, data sources, or tasks.

## Technologies
- **Langchain**: For building and managing workflows.
- **Python**: For orchestrating tasks and managing models.
- **APIs**: Allows easy model integration.
- **Task Scheduling**: Uses custom logic for task scheduling.

## How It Works
1. **Model Registration**: Models are registered with the LangGraph Supervisor.
2. **Workflow Definition**: Define workflows where models interact based on triggers or dependencies.
3. **Task Execution**: Once workflows are defined, tasks are automatically executed in sequence.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/langgraph-supervisor.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Set up your models or APIs.
4. Run the supervisor:
    ```bash
    python supervisor.py
    ```

## Usage
- Define workflows using a simple YAML configuration.
- The system will automatically handle task scheduling and model interaction, with feedback and logging.
